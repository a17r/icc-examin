Building from Sources:

ICC Examin depends on following libraries:

  # FLTK version >= 1.1.4
    you need to configure fltk with several options enabled
    --enable-threads is needed for threads support in ICC Examin
    --enable-xft is ok for antialiased fonts
    --enable-debug is generally a good choice
    --enable-shared is sometimes a good choice for smaller executables
  # lcms version >= 1.14; 1.15 is recommended due to CGATS parsing is better
  # FLU version >= 2.14 for a convenient file browser (optionally)
  # FTGL for a text inside OpenGL (optionally)
  # argyll for 3D gamut visualisations (optionally, external, binaries see above)
  # Oyranos for setting options (optionally)
  # for osX only (since version 0.30) install GNU gettext (and libiconv?)

For building unpack the tgz file and type #make; make install.
Optionally you can specifiy an other than the default prefix /opt/local by typing:

    #configure --prefix=/what/you/like
    #make
    #make install (optionally; may need root rights)
    #make rpm (linux)
    #make bundle/package (osX)

    to uninstall
    #make uninstall
    #make unbundle (osX)

Install Oyranos before ICC Examin to get Oyranos support compiled in ICC Examin. Oyranos is available from my site too www.behrmann.name

Source code packages need further compiling and installing to work as an executable program. osX should work but without Oyranos. There is no windows support currently. Sorry.
