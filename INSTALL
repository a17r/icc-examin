Supported operating systems:
If you run a posix compatible *nix systems, including *BSD, Linux, Solaris and
osX chances are not bad that the sources will compile.
There is no Windows support currently. Sorry.


Requirements:
  o FLTK version >= 1.1.4
    you need to configure fltk with several options enabled
    --enable-threads  is needed for threads support in ICC Examin
    --enable-xft      is ok for antialiased fonts
    --enable-debug    is generally a good choice
    --enable-shared   is sometimes a good choice for smaller executables
  o lcms version >= 1.14
  o Oyranos for colour management
  o FTGL version >= 2.1.2 for showing text inside OpenGL (optionally)
  o Argyll for a special mode of 3D gamut visualisations (optionally, external
    iccgamut)
  o GNU gettext (and libiconv?) for osX only


Manual steps:
For building decompress and unpack the source archive file and run
  # configure 
  # make
  # make install         (optionally; this may need administration rights)

    special binary package targets are
  # make rpm             (linux)
  # make bundle/package  (osX)

    to uninstall
  # make uninstall
  # make unbundle        (osX)

    show all available configure options
  # configure --help


Hints:
If a package is not found, include the path to the configuration scripts, 
like the one to fltk-config in your executable path with
  # PATH=$PATH:/to/my/installation/bin
As well the pkgconfig file like lcms.pc needs often to be configured with the 
PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable like follows (bash):
  # PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/to/my/installation/lib/pkgconfig
