Supported operating systems:
If you run a posix compatible *nix systems, including *BSD, Linux, Solaris and
osX chances are not bad that the sources will compile.
There is no Windows support currently. Sorry.


Requirements:
  o FLTK version >= 1.1.4
    you need to configure fltk with several options enabled
    --enable-threads  is needed for threads support in ICC Examin
    --enable-xft      is ok for antialiased fonts
    --enable-debug    is generally a good choice
    --enable-shared   is sometimes a good choice for smaller executables
  o lcms version >= 1.14
  o Oyranos for colour management
  o FTGL version >= 2.1.2 for showing text inside OpenGL (optionally)
  o Argyll for a special mode of 3D gamut visualisations (optionally, external
    iccgamut)
  o GNU gettext (and libiconv?) for osX only


Manual steps:
For building decompress and unpack the source archive file and run
  # configure 
  # make
  # make install         (optionally; this may need administration rights)

    special binary package targets are
  # make rpm             (linux)
  # make bundle/package  (osX)

    to uninstall
  # make uninstall
  # make unbundle        (osX)

    show all available configure options
  # configure --help

  From ColourWiki is a build script available. It helps with Oyranos, some of
  its dependencies and with ICC Examin. See:
  http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Oyranos/git
  https://www.behrmann.name/temp/icc_examin-build.sh

  Debian (2009-11):
    1. Enable universe repo in package manager
    2. sudo apt-get install argyll
    3. sudo apt-get install build-essential libfltk1.1-dev pkg-config libftgl-dev libxpm-dev libxext-dev libxinerama-dev libxxf86vm-dev liblcms1-dev libpng12-dev libtiff4-dev mesa-utils libglw1-mesa-dev git git-core libmsgcat-perl libcups2-dev libxrandr-dev gettext fluid libxml2-dev libxfixes-dev
    4. wget http://www.libraw.org/data/LibRaw-Lite-0.7.2-Linux.tar.gz #unpack and make ; sudo make install
    5. Elektra from http://www.libelektra.org download elektra-0.7.0.tar.gz from http://sourceforge.net/projects/elektra/files/ and ./configure;make; sudo make install
    6. Oyranos is needed from git: instruction
       http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Oyranos/git
       do a "sudo ldconfig" after installing.
    7. Icc Examin see above Oyranos instruction.
git clone git://www.oyranos.org/git/icc_examin



Hints:
If a package is not found, include the path to the configuration scripts, 
like the one to fltk-config in your executable path with
  # PATH=$PATH:/to/my/installation/bin
As well the pkgconfig file like lcms.pc needs often to be configured with the 
PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable like follows (bash):
  # PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/to/my/installation/lib/pkgconfig
